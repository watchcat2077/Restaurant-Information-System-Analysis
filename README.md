### **Project Overview**
---
The aim of this project is to analyze and design an integrated IT system for a restaurant chain operating multiple outlets. The system focuses on efficient management of employees, menus, and customer orders to enhance overall operational efficiency.

**Key Skills Demonstrated**
---
**Stakeholder Analysis:** I took the lead in identifying all internal and external stakeholders (e.g., Restaurant Manager, Cook, Customers), analyzing their interests and influence, and defining the engagement strategy to ensure all perspectives were considered in the system design

**Use Case & UML Modeling:** I was responsible for developing several key UML diagrams.Specifically,I authored the fully developed use case descriptions for the 'Customer' and 'Restaurant Manager' actors, and collaborated on creating the overall Use Case Diagram and the Domain Model Class Diagram.

**Feasibility Analysis:** I contributed significantly to the economic feasibility study, where I helped outline the estimated project costs, anticipated tangible benefits like increased efficiency, and potential risks such as cost overruns

**System Vision & Strategy:** I was instrumental in shaping the initial project direction by writing the **System Vision Document**. This involved defining the core problem statement, outlining the proposed system's capabilities , and articulating the key business benefits for the client.

**Financial & Feasibility Analysis:** I performed a significant part of the economic analysis to prove the project's viability. My work included:
    * **Quantifying Project Approval Factors** by estimating development costs (personnel, hardware, software).
    * Conducting the **Cost/Benefit Analysis**, which involved projecting annual tangible benefits  and calculating the project's Net Present Value (NPV) and Payback Period.
